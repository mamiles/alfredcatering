  creative, very cost friendly, and always leave your house cleaner than 

  when they started!  I love the service they provide.</span><br>

<p align="left" class="style1"><span class="clientQuote">I was extremely pleased with Alfred 

catering of my 

  daughter's wedding! They drove down to Corpus Christi and took care of 

  every detail. The beautiful Victorian House took a backseat to all the 

  compliments about the food! Every guest raved about the dinner, and the 

  service. If you're planning an event, I recommend you let Alfred can handle all the details, and you can be a guest at your own

  party!
